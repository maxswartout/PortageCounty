      <textarea name="message">Dear Sheriff Zuchowski,

I am writing as a concerned member of the public who recently learned that you hired Dan Lajack to serve in the Portage County Sheriff’s Office just three weeks after he resigned from his previous position in Lake County.

According to public reports, Mr. Lajack resigned prior to a scheduled disciplinary hearing related to an incident at a bar in Hinckley, Ohio, where he unlawfully detained, physically assaulted, and took the wallet and phone of a man who was simply trying to enjoy a drink while in town for work. The man had committed no crime. This conduct is not only deeply troubling but also appears to violate basic civil rights protections.

I am worried about the message this sends to the community and the potential risk of such conduct occurring again here in Portage County. We deserve law enforcement officers who uphold the Constitution, protect civil liberties, and treat all people with dignity and respect — regardless of their appearance, background, or perceived immigration status.

Therefore, I respectfully request the following:

1. That Deputy Lajack be required to complete bias and civil rights training as a condition of his continued employment.
2. That you issue a public statement condemning Mr. Lajack’s actions during the Hinckley incident and affirming to the people of Portage County that this type of conduct will not be tolerated in our community.

I believe leadership means not just hiring capable individuals, but holding them accountable when they fall short of the public’s trust. I urge you to take this opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to integrity, transparency, and equal protection under the law.

Sincerely,
[Your name]</textarea>
